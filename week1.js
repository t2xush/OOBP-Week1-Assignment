1. name - the name of the person

3. age - the age of the person
4. fullName - the full name of the person (name + surname)
5. isAdult - true if the person is an adult (age >= 18), false otherwise

4. fullName - the full name of the person (name + surname)
5. isAdult - true if the person is an adult (age >= 18), false otherwise

The function should return a string in the following format:
"The person <name>, <surname> is <age> years old, and is an adult" 
or "The person <name>, <surname> is <age> years old, and is an minor" 
if the person is not an adult.

Notice that <name>, <surname> and <age> fields should be replaced with the actual values from the object.
